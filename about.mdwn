## My aims and plans

* Create a clean (secure, fast, and comfortable) Linux distribution
* To stimulate the FOSS development, to boost the acceptance of FOSS.
* Create tools that are needed for himself and to make them  available for use in other Unices as well (like cinit, ccollect are available already)
* Group together some people, interested in aiding the success of FOSS
 * Paid people
 * "Normal people" (those, that are just using the computer, not using to hack with it)
 * Try to get different groups to work closer (like *BSD with the Linux community)
    * I want to study computer science again
  * Learn more, to create better software
  * this time without the focus on economy
