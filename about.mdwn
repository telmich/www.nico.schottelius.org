My aims and plans

    * Create a clean (secure, fast, and comfortable) Linux distribution
    * To stimulate the FOSS development, to boost the acceptance of FOSS.
    * Create tools that are needed for himself and to make them  available for use in other Unices as well (like cinit, ccollect are available already)
    * Group together some people, interested in aiding the success of FOSS
          o Paid people
          o "Normal people" (those, that are just using the computer, not using to hack with it)
          o Try to get different groups to work closer (like *BSD with the Linux community)
    * I want to study computer science again
          o Learn more, to create better software
          o this time without the focus on economy
