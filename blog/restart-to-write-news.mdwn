[[!meta title="Started to write news again"]]

A long time ago I stopped to publish news on the
[old newssite](http://nico.schottelius.org/notizbuch-blog), for several reasons.
The most important one is that

* there have been many other much more important things in my life

As I am currently coming back to my usual technical stuff like

* testing software
 * finding bugs
 * writing patches
* coding software
 * publishing and getting feedback for it
* visiting conferences
* etc.

I thougt it's a good time to start writing news again.
Especially as one of my biggest software projects seems to reach
version 1.0...

By the way, I also had to migrate the plone site to a new server...
