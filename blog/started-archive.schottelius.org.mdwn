[[!meta title="Started Archive.Schottelius.Org"]]

After a long time running websites, I decided to take some websites
of mine down and to migrate the interesting parts into this website.

The unmodified versions have now a place to rest until I stop
running websites: [archive.schottelius.org](http://archive.schottelius.org)
(and also the German version [archiv.schottelius.org](http://archiv.schottelius.org))
is the new home for my old websites.
