[[!meta title="Released ceofhack 0.6"]]

A new version of [[ceofhack|software/ceofhack]] has been released,
which includes a clean UI interface.

It also includes a "sample UI", **ui-cmd**, which can be used
on the command line for testing.

In theory, all new commands can be handled asynchronously,
the implementation is still synchronised though.

Have fun with it and let me know, whether it works for you or not!
