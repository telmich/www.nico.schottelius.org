[[!meta title="Adobe Source Code Pro font - Nice to read, but not on small sizes"]]

A friend of mine pointed me to the
release of the
[Source Code Pro font](https://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html)
from Adobe, which can be found on
[github](https://github.com/adobe/Source-Code-Pro).

I told urxvt to use the font using the escape sequence

    printf '\33]50;%s\007' "xft:Source Code Pro"    

which looks like this:

[[!img scp.png alt="Source Code Pro in a terminal"]]

(this required a new urxvt instance to be started, because urxvtd seems
not to pickup font additions during run)

As the resolution on the MacBook Air is "only" 1440x900, I am normally
using the **fixed** font to have a lot of space for the text. This
is how it looks like:

[[!img fixed.png alt="Source Code Pro in a terminal"]]

Putting both terminals side by side, I am loosing 12 rows from the size
different.

As the 
[Source Code Pro font is not designed for this small size](https://github.com/adobe/Source-Code-Pro/issues/28)
I happily continue to use fixed for now.

Besides being to large for my use case, Source Code Pro could become a quite
interesting font for coders.

If you are interested in more usable fonts for terminals,
have a look at the
[[Xorg terminal emulator font list|docs/xorg-terminal-emulator-fonts]].
