[[!meta title="Take ruby, ncurses and ceofhack, get fui"]]

For the lessons of the software development I have to create
a nice project in some object orientated language. After
digging around what would interest me, I chose
[ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), because it feels like it could be
an interesting language.

The next question was, what kind of software to write. As
the EOF project, namely [[ceofhack|software/ceofhack]] still
needs a user interface, I decided to write one.

As I need an user interface, I would use myself, I wanted to use
something I can use on the console, which led me to
[ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/).

Eventually I found out that there is also support for ncurses
in ruby, [ncurses-ruby](http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/).

Perfectly! The only thing that has been missing was a name. As
I am a very simple thinking person, I chose *fui*, as an abreviation
of *fancy user interface*.

The
[git repository](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=fui;a=summary)
has already been published, expect more news soon!
