[[!meta title="Ikiwiki is slow"]]

As you probably know, this [[website|about/websites/]] is generated
by [ikiwiki](http://www.ikiwiki.info/), which does a pretty nice
job for people who like to write their websites without a fancy GUI,
but still do not want to write HTML or XHTML directly.

As I [[migrated|migration-1-configs]]
[[some|migration-2-freebsd-raid-monitoring-foss]]
[[parts|migration-3-ccollect]]
of [[my other websites|cinit-migrated]]
[[into this one|migration-4-gpm]],
I realised that ikiwiki becomes slower and slower.

A normal run with

    ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup

takes about ***15*** minutes!
If I run it with

    ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup --refresh

it still takes about ***1-2*** minutes. I clearly understand that
my site is not the smallest anymore (

    [16:38] ikn:nicoweb% find . -type f | wc -l
    31015
    [16:38] ikn:nicoweb% find . -type d | wc -l
    3092

), but I still think that it should be possible to (re-)generate
it in less than 30 seconds. I know that the author,
[Joey Hess](http://kitenet.net/~joey/), is very open to feedback
and does a great job, but as I always regenerate the website before a public
release and that costs my time, it motivated me to write this article.

    Dear Joey, keep up the good work, but speedup ikiwiki, please!
