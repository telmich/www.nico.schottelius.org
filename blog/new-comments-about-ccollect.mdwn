[[!meta title="New comments about ccollect published"]]

If you are a FOSS-developer, like [[me|about]], you'll understand
that getting feedback for you application is a great thing and
helps either to improve the software or to feel good.

In case of [[ccollect|software/ccollect]], the included script
**tools/report_success** submits aids users to give feedback.

If the user allows me to publish the quote, it will
appear on [[ccollect's quotes site|software/ccollect/quotes]],
like it happened again today.

The motivation of this post is

 * to show you that ccollect is great software
 * to show FOSS developers how to get happy with their great software
