[[!meta title="Published ceofhack"]]

Yesterday I published the first version of [[ceofhack|software/ceofhack]],
the p2p onion routing chat program.

With this version other developers can begin to implement their own fancy
stuff to be used in the EOF network. For instance, it is possible to
create transport protocols that (mis-)use DNS, HTTP, SMTP, ...

Before the release we had a testing night at the
[Chaosdock](http://www.ccczh.ch/Events/Chaosdock/2009/), which revealed
something quite interesting:

    Mac OS X does not have a proper poll implementation.

The poll() call on Mac OS X lead to an infinite loop, setting revents to
***POLLNVAL*** on a file deskriptor used for reading.

But there is a [poll emulation routine](http://www.clapper.org/software/poll/)
available.

(This issue was reported and debugged by ballessay.)
