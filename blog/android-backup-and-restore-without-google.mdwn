[[!meta title="Backup and Restore Android Devices without Google"]]

## Introduction

If you want to backup and restore your contacts and 
calendar entries without going via Google, this blog entry is for you.

## Requirements

This article only applies to rooted Android devices which have
a ssh server (like
[SSHDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=berserker.android.apps.sshdroid&hl=de))
running.

## Implementation

Within a seminar in my study I developed a simple shell script that
connects to the device via ssh, copies away or back the relevant
sqlite database.

The source can be found in 
[the git repository](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=hszt/rooted_android_backup;a=tree).
