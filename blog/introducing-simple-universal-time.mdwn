[[!meta title="Introducing Simple Universal Time (SUT)"]]

For some time I've been discussing this idea with some friends:
One simple time format that simplifies our lifes: 
**Simple Universal Time (SUT)**.

Instead of relying on time zones, it simplifies life by
reducing life to the max: It skips time zones.
Instead of using 24 hours, 60 minutes and 60 seconds
scheme, it is a metric centric time: Simple Universal
Time knows about 10 hours a day, with 100 minutes
and 100 seconds.

Thanks to **Stefanos Kornilios Mitsis Poiitidis**
you can see the
[current time in SUT](http://telmich.github.io/sut).
The [[Simple Universal Time page|docs/sut]] shows in detail
how it works.

Make your life easier by switching to SUT - your brain and
your phone partners will be thankful!
