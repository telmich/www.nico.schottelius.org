[[!meta title="Cdist 2.0.11 released"]]

This is a security bugfix release:
Cdist has so far used whatever umask has been setup on the local and remote
system. This may have lead to 
**/var/lib/cdist** being accessable by others, 
including data from explorers.

This release fixes this bug and setups a **umask of 077** within cdist.
That means if you are using the **__file** type without the **--mode**
parameter, your files may now have "more secure permissions" than you
would like.

It is recommended to update as soon as possible.
For more information visit the [[cdist homepage|software/cdist]].
