[[!meta title="Migrated ccollect"]]


As i started to hack on [cinit](http://unix.schottelius.org) again,
I tried to get it running on Debian in a VM.

I took the old configuration from my last computer and tried to boot
with cinit, which failed, because the udev stuff changed.

So I added a udev service, which uses /etc/init.d/udev for switching
on.

After booting the VM, I recognized, that the service
***mount/proc*** (which mounts /proc...) fails. Mount claims that
/proc it is already mounted!

    237    [ -d /proc/1 ] || mount -n /proc

But /proc needs /writable, to write into mtab.
/ is not being fscked, because udev is not started

[unix.schottelius.org](http://unix.schottelius.org) website

home
