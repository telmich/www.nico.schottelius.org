## FreeBSD Raid monitoring

The well-known article about
[[FreeBSD raid monitoring|docs/freebsd-raid-monitoring]] is now also
migrated to this site.

Please update your references from

   * http://nico.schottelius.org/documentations/freebsd/freebsd-raid-monitoring/

to

   * [[http://www.nico.schottelius.org/docs/freebsd-raid-monitoring/|docs/freebsd-raid-monitoring]]

There are also some updates pending for the article, which will soon be
implemented. I just waited for the new CMS to be available, to do it.

## The term FOSS

Additionally, the [[artice about the term FOSS|docs/foss]] is migrated from

   * http://nico.schottelius.org/documentations/foss/the-term-foss/

to

   * [[http://www.nico.schottelius.org/docs/the-term-foss|docs/the-term-foss]]
