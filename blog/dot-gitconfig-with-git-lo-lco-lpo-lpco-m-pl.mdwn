[[!meta title="Added new short commands to .gitconfig (lo, lco, lpc, lpco, m, pl)"]]

As some of you are using my
[[git configuration|configs/dot-gitconfig]], there's an updated
version now, that includes a short version of **--pretty=oneline**
option for **git log**, which is very useful if you want to get
a quick impression on what is going on. Thus the new short commands
are (just an o added at the end):

    git lo
    git lco
    git lpo
    git lpco

Furthermore I added the following new short commands:

    git m (merge)
    git pl (pull)

Have fun, other lazy people like me!
