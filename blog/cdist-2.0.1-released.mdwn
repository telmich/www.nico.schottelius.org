... which mainly includes bugfixes to the bugs seen in the last
days.

But it also adds the beginning feature of object dependent
code execution:

Imagine you want to restart apache, but only if __apache_vhost
generated code, you can do so now, by checking all 
__apache_vhost objects for the "changed" flag and if and only if
the flag is existing, generate the restart command.

You can access all objects through the __global variable.

This feature is in its early stage and I'd be pretty happy to
get some feedback, if it useful for you and if you've some
other enhancements to propose.

As usual, the best proposals are the ones with included merge
request to a git source :-p
