[[!meta title="RPM for ccollect 0.8 available"]]

Last week Nikita Koshikov dropped
[an email](archiv) to the
[ccollect mailinglist](http://l.schottelius.org/pipermail/ccollect/2009-September/000035.html),
providing a spec file and a rpm packet.

It's very interesting, some years ago users of ccollect
provided Debian packages, today the rpm users seem to be more active.

Written enough: Thanks for the [[ccollect RPM package|software/ccollect]],
Nikita!
