[[!meta title="I want a decentralised bugtracker"]]

I have about 50 different website accounts for submitting and reading
bugs. I use about 4 different bugtrackers regulary
(bugzilla, launchpad, ditz, Debians reportbug).

And I do not want to create another account at a different site
again. No. What I want is different:

I want to have one tool, that

 * allows me to track bugs of different projects with different systems
   (similar to [launchpad](http://www.launchpad.net))
 * to mirror the information locally, including history
   (like most [version control systems (VCS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control))
 * to add or search a bug, while being offline
   (like [git](http://git-scm.com/))
 * has a usable command line interface
   (like [zsh](http://www.zsh.org))

So in practise, it should look something like this:

    % tool
    tool> init-bug-db /path/to/somewhere
    tool> bug-source add project1 bugzilla://where-it-is
    tool> bug-source add project2 ditz://where-it-is
    tool> bug-source list
     project1
     project2
    tool> bug-source show project2
     * can submit
     * url
    tool> bug query project1 a-search-string
    tool> bug add project1
     [either ask for input or add them after the project name]
    tool> bug pull project1 # get latest bugs
    tool> bug push project1 # submit latest bug (-changes)

Of course all the commands should also be available on the command line as
options. If you have already created such a tool or are interested in creating
such a tool, do not hesitate to [[contact|about]] me!
