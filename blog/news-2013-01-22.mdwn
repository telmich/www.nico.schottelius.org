## Dell sells Notebook with Ubuntu on it

As all of you know, Ubuntu is the Linux distro being mostly marketed
currently. Dell, on the other hand has trouble staying in the business
and rumours say that Dell is searching for some investors.

Thus it's interesting to hear that
[Dell is now selling the XPS 13" with Ubuntu on it](http://www.dell.com/us/soho/p/xps-13-linux/pd?dgc=AF&cid=6504&lid=167784&acd=240157118117280)

## Linux is (becoming) a gaming plattform

Various different news show you an interesting movement for 2013:
Android (and thus Linux) is becoming a gaming plattform:

[Valve ported Steam to Linux](http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2012/07/17/valve-steam-linux/)
and begins to 
[promote Linux to Windows users](http://www.geek.com/articles/games/valve-starts-promoting-steam-for-linux-to-windows-users-20130121/).
[The Ouya console is successfully being developed](http://www.ouya.tv/)
and even [they have a competitor, the GameStick](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/872297630/gamestick-the-most-portable-tv-games-console-ever), which is also based on Android.

## Microsoft to (finally) die

Thanks to the decreasing PC market and people focussing on swiping around their
tablets (instead of doing real work [tm]), Microsoft got a hard time.

It even got so worse that they are selling Windows 8 for almost nothing. But hey,
who wants a disease for free anyway?

Seeing the Nokia/Microsoft deal in which Nokia agreed to build Windows phones is
like seeing someone betting on a dying horse, but it is worse than that:
Why would you get a Windows phone, if you can buy an Android or IOS based phone?

Reading about 
[Microsoft probably selling the
Xbox](http://www.geek.com/articles/games/analyst-believes-microsoft-will-sell-off-xbox-division-maybe-even-to-sony-20130121/) gives another indicator for someone totally being frustrated - probably
realising the good times are over.

This hasn't though changed the FUD approach of Microsoft, which
is [infamously known for their Anti-Campaings](msad.jpg) like the new
[scroogled](http://www.scroogled.com/) one.

## Cdist gets its own domain

Suggestions to FOSS I write or maintain is highly appreciated.
Getting a domain for [[cdist|software/cdist]] was proposed and will
soon be activated.
