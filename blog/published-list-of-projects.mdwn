[[!meta title="Published list of projects"]]

The day before yesterday I was hacking on [[ccollect|software/ccollect]]
and finished a lot of things to be done for version 0.8.

When I was done, I was sitting in the train and thought:

    Which project to hack on, after this release?

There are a lot of projects I started, many of them not nearly finished.
And even more ideas, what I **could** work on
(a lot of my ideas can be found in the
[nsdocuments](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=nsdocuments) repository).

A listing of my project directory shows over 30 different projects.
To get an overview of what I am working on already, I used the listing
as a base to create the new [[project list page|about/projects]].

I'm now cleaning up the projects directory and may also publish some
(already finished) projects, which never made it to the public.

And until **ccollect** 0.8 is released, I will continue to think about
the next interesting project to work on.
