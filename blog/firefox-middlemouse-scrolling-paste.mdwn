[[!meta title="How to scroll and paste with the middle mouse button in Firefox"]]

If you're like me and use firefox with a trackpoint (i.e. no scroll "buttons"),
you're probably also happy with these settings:

## middlemouse.paste=true

This adds pasting from the x clipboard.

## middlemouse.contentLoadURL=false

Do not try to load website from content in clipboard.

## general.autoScroll=true

Enable scrolling using the middle mouse button.

Now firefox behaves similar to [conkeror](http://conkeror.org/),
which is my default browser currently.
