[[!meta title="Moving on: Migrating from #cLinux to #cstar"]]

There has been the IRC channel #cLinux, which I created for
development on cLinux, a "better Linux distribution", which
I'm not focussing anymore.

cLinux became more a "cunix" project or, well, not even limiting
to Unix. Thus the idea of **cstar** was born and made reality.

Thus, if you've just joined #cLinux, please move on to #cstar,
the home of c*.
