## Who I am

Dear reader of this post, my name is Nico Schottelius, I am digital nomad searching
for a great notebook. 
My requirements are (in my opinion) simple, but I struggle to find any vendor marketing
a notebook that fulfils my needs.

## What I search

It is as easy as this:

  * 12 to 14 inch screen
    * Preferred something that does not have senseless big borders
  * Resoultion at least 1600x900 
    * 1600x900 allows three terminals next to each other
    * 3200x1800 is ok as well, but needs some high dpi tunings under Linux
  * Screen should be readable in sun light
    * Bright enough
    * Not reflecting too much (like the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro!)
  * At least 8G RAM
    * 16 GiB RAM is ok as well
  * At least 512 GB SSD 
    * 1TB ok as well
    * I store pictures on the notebook
  * Battery lifetime >= 6h
    * Real 6 hours, not vendor claimed 6 hours
    * Preferred 12+ hours, so I can stay without power a day long
  * Good keyboard
    * I know, very subjective, but something that let's me type hours without problems in my hands
    * Thinkpads are usually fine, Mac stuff usually as well
