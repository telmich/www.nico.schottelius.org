[[!meta title="Cinit 0.3pre16 released"]]

The next release of [[cinit|software/cinit]],
***0.3pre16*** did not take as long as the
[[previous release|blog/cinit-0.3pre15-released]].

This is more or less a cleanup release, to start into
real development and begin testing on different operating
systems.

If you're an init-system interested person and want to
try cinit on a non-Linux-OS, I would be thankful for
a report.
