[[!meta title="MacBook Air 4,2: Xorg/Synaptics touchpad click and move fixed"]]

## Introduction

For some time when you pressed button 1 on the Mac Book Air 4,2 under Linux/Xorg
and moved the finger (classic **select** something on the screen behaviour),
a button 3 (right click) even was emitted.

## Current status

As reported on [bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45396),
it seems Peter Hutterer
[merged the relevant fixes](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-synaptics/commit/?id=6c457c0c61a0834361f45a073148db7b4c9be40b)
into the master tree, which were submitted by
Chase Douglas in the patches
[9210](http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9210/) until
[9219](http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9219/)
([9214](http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9214/) and
[9215](http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9215/) seem
to be the relevant ones)

I haven't tested it so far, but the commits around the merge look good!
