[[!meta title="LXC still insecure (since 2011)"]]

For a customer of mine I was researching whether
we could use [LXC](http://linuxcontainers.org/) for
virtualisation. 
The customer is migrating to Debian 7, 
[which does not contain OpenVZ anymore](https://wiki.debian.org/OpenVz).

Although the 
[Debian template bug](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.containers.lxc.general/5102) is still not fixed, I first thought it would still
be usable when writing our own templates. But it turns
out that LXC still allows to
[execute code as root on the host since 2011](http://blog.bofh.it/debian/id_413).

More background information for those of you who are currently considering
LXC:

   * [Ubuntu / User Namespaces in Linux](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserNamespace)
   * [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LXC#MAJOR_Temporary_Problems_with_LXC_-_READ_THIS)
   * [Debian Bug Report](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=680469)

So for the moment my recommendation is [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) (KVM has been merged back into QEMU!).
