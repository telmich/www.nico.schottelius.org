[[!meta title="Published smtp_logger"]]

Some days ago I cleaned up my
[[project directory|about/projects]] and found
[[smtp_logger|software/smtp_logger]], a SMTP debug utility.

I cleaned it a bit up and made it compile with **-Werror**.

So, another piece of [[free and open source software|foss]]
released, have fun with it!
