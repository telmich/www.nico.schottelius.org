[[!meta title="Cinit 0.3pre15 released"]]

It has been a long time since the last cinit release,
but now it's there! You can find it
[[at the bottom of the new website|software/cinit]].

Let me know if there are any issues with this update, because the
child handling stuff radically changed (to be reliable).
