[[!meta title="Getting the keyboard, touchpad and correct screen resolution working on the MacBook Air 4,2"]]

## Introduction

If you are running Linux on the MacBook Air 4,2 and have any of the following problems,
this article is for you:

 * FN key not working / modifying keys
 * Touchpad not working in Multitouch mode
 * Resolution is 1280x800 instead of 1440x900


## Touchpad and Keyboard

In Jiris [for-next branch](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jikos/hid.git;a=summary)
of the hid tree the keyboard and touchpad issues have been solved.


## Screen resolution

Keith fixed the screen resolution issues in his tree that you can retrieve:

    git clone -b fix-edp-vdd-power git://people.freedesktop.org/~keithp/linux


## Getting both fixes

Until the changes are merged into Linus' tree, I've setup a tree that merged the
two previous ones:

 * [gitweb](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=foreign/linux-keith-jiri-mba;a=summary)
 * git://git.schottelius.org/foreign/linux-keith-jiri-mba

I've used the config.gz from Archlinux as base for .config and added the
new config options, which resulted in a 
[working .config for the MacBook Air](dot-config).
