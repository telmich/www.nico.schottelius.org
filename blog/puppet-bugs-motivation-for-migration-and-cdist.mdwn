[[!meta title="Puppet bugs that motivated me to migrate away from puppet and write cdist"]]

## Introduction

For a long time I had a "secret list" of bugs that made me going crazy when
using puppet. But as I get more often asked ***Why have you writen
[[cdist|software/cdist]] and migrate away from puppet?***, I'm publishing the
list here, to give it a real home.

Early clearification, before rumors come up and bad blood created:
This is **not intented** to be a **bash puppet page**, but a
**I don't need to re-explain why I moved away from puppet and
have written cdist page**.
