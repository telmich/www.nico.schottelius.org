[[!meta title="ccollect 0.8 includes many changes like quiet_if_down"]]

I'm currently updating the changes file (**doc/changes/next**) of
[[ccollect|software/ccollect]] and realised that version 0.8 will be
one of the greatest releases of ccollect:

Months ago, when I went through my [[projects list|about/projects]],
I thought that there will not be many changes for ccollect anymore:

It is running stable, has a lot of features and is still very short
(around 600 lines of code).

Now I have a list of more than 10 big changes
for the upcoming 0.8 release of ccollect!

## Be quiet!

One of the new features is "***quiet_if_down***": If you enable this
option, ccollect will be much more quiet, if the source is not
reachable. Very useful for backing up mobile devices
(cell phones, notebooks, watches, etc.)!

Thanks to John, who implemented this feature!
