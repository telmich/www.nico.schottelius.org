[[!meta title="QT4 user interface prototype added to ceofhack"]]

In the last weeks there has been a lot of stuff
done in the **user_interface** branch of [[ceofhack|software/ceofhack]].

The communication between a user interface (UI) and ceofhack
is described (read as in: finished!). Thus, if you are a (G)UI programmer
and like the idea of ceofhack, you can now begin to implement your
user interface.

This is what someone already did and thus there is now a prototype of
a QT4 gui in the **user_interface** branch available!

This new UI does indeed look much better than the included command line
user interface (**ui-cmd**), but it's your decision what to use with
[[ceofhack|software/ceofhack]].
