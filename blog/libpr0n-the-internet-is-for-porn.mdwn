[[!meta title="libpr0n: an image rendering library for Mozilla"]]

It is neither a secret that
[sex sells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_sells) nor that
Internet development is heavily influenced by
[pornography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography).

I know the great image viewer
[pornview](http://pornview.sourceforge.net/)
(which I replaced with [gthumb](http://gthumb.sourceforge.net/)
some time ago), but today I found another interesting piece of code made
for viewing pornography: [libpr0n](http://www.libpr0n.com/). It is
described as

    "the smallest, fastest and most standards compliant Mozilla image library ever made"

According to the [f.a.q](http://www.libpr0n.com/faq.html), the aim is

    "to render pornographic images in an efficient way"

which reminded me of the sentence
["The Internet is for porn."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Q).

By the way, I found the library by digging into
[ikiwiks buglist](http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/), which
references the
[lack of html5 support in ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/html5_support/),
which made me interested in [HTML5](http://html5.org/), which seems to
be [developed quite open](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ) by
the editor [Ian Hickson](http://ian.hixie.ch/), who writes
[a blog](http://ln.hixie.ch/) and has
[an index of websites he is related to](http://index.hixie.ch/), which
referenced to [libpr0n](http://www.libpr0n.com/).
