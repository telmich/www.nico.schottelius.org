[[!meta title="ccollect 0.8 will soon be released"]]

I'm just pretty impressed by a
[great discussion on the ccollect mailinglist](http://l.schottelius.org/pipermail/ccollect/2009-July/000003.html), in which the automatic selection of the right interval was
discussed.

Just some hours before I started to do
[some cleanups](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=cLinux/ccollect.git;a=summary) on
[[ccollect|software/ccollect]] and now I'm pretty motivated to finish
those changes and to include the proposed one.

So stay tuned and expect ccollect-0.8 to be available soon!
