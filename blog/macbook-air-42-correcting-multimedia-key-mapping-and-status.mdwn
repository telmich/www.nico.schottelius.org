[[!meta title="Correcting the multimedia keys mapping on the MacBook Air 4,2"]]

## Introduction

The mapping of the multimedia keys of the MacBook Air 4,2 (probably earlier
ones as well) was
[slightly off by one and had the Eject key mapped](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/17/326),
although the MBA does not have an optical drive.

## Two trees available with fixes

The patch against [Jiris for-next branch of the hid-tree](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jikos/hid.git;a=summary) can be found
in [my **mba42-fixes** branch](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=foreign/linux-jiri-hid;a=summary).

The second tree is the one I use to run with the
[[correct keyboard mapping and screen resolultion patches|macbook-air-42-touchpad-keyboard-correct-screen-resolution]], which contains the change in the
[**keyboardmappingfix** branch](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=foreign/linux-keith-jiri-mba;a=summary).

## General status / todo list

The notebook is pretty good usable with the current patches applied. There are
some gotchas, though, which I'll try to fix in the next time:

 * [network process hang issue in the **brcmsmac** driver](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/18/145)
 * The mouse pointer does not move when the mouse button is pressed (probably a configuration problem of the synaptics touchpad)
 * Brightness is not adjusted in xorg when pressing FN-F1 (but can be done via **echo VALUE > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/drm/card0/card0-eDP-1/intel_backlight/brightness**)
 * Display is not switched off when lid is closed (acpi reports the lid event, though) (probably related to the previous problem)
 * I'm not sure how to adjust the keyboard backlight correctly:
  * Correct map the ambient light values (0-255) to the keyboard light brightness (0-255)
   * Straight brightness=255-ambient_light does not look good
  * Probably off, when the lid is closed
  * See [kbsd](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=kbsd;a=summary) for an early idea of what can
    be done
