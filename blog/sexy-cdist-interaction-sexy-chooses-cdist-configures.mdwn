[[!meta title="Sexy and cdist interaction: Sexy chooses hosts, cdist configures"]]

## Introduction

Version 2 of [[sexy|software/sexy]], 
the Swiss Army Knife for inventory management, is already
**using** and **usable** from [[cdist/software/cdist]].

This is the first blog post of a series showing examples of
using sexy and cdist.

## Example

Cdist is executed with a list of hosts to operate on:

    % cdist config
    usage: cdist config [-h] [-d] [-v] [-c CDIST_HOME] [-i MANIFEST] [-p] [-s]
                        [--remote-copy REMOTE_COPY] [--remote-exec REMOTE_EXEC]
                        host [host ...]


Sexy in turn is able to manage hosts, mac addresses and networks:

    % sexy
    usage: sexy [-h] [-d] [-v] [-V] {net-ipv4,host,mac} ...
    sexy: error: too few arguments

Sexy knows about a command to list hosts, named **host list**.
So I can use sexy to tell cdist which hosts to configure. For instance
all dhcp servers:

    % sexy host list | grep dhcp
    dhcp-vm-inx01.intra.local.ch
    dhcp-vm-inx02.intra.local.ch
    dhcp-vm-snr01.intra.local.ch
    dhcp-vm-snr02.intra.local.ch

    % ./bin/cdist config -vp $(sexy host list | grep dhcp)
    INFO: dhcp-vm-inx01.intra.local.ch: Running global explorers
    INFO: dhcp-vm-snr01.intra.local.ch: Running global explorers
    INFO: dhcp-vm-snr02.intra.local.ch: Running global explorers
    INFO: dhcp-vm-inx02.intra.local.ch: Running global explorers
    ...

Sexy, isn't it?
