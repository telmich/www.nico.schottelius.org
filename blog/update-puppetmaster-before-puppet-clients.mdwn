[[!meta title="Puppet: Update the puppetmaster before the puppet clients"]]

After I updated one server today from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
Lenny to Squeeze, puppetd stopped to work and printed the following error:

    sgssr240003:~# puppetd --server puppet.inf.ethz.ch  --test --ca_port 8141
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    err: Could not request certificate: Error 405 on SERVER: Method Not Allowed
    Exiting; failed to retrieve certificate and watiforcert is disabled

I was a bit confused and did not find useful hints regarding that error message.
In the IRC channel [#puppet](irc://irc.freenode.org/#puppet) I was told that this
can happen, if the puppet client (**puppetd**) is newer than the puppetmaster.

And indeed, when I compared the versions, puppetmasterd was running version
**0.24.8**, whereas puppetd was **0.25.1**.

After I upgraded puppetmasterd to **0.25.1**, it is runs fine again.

If you also have been running into this problem, the article is for you!
