[[!meta title="Published puppet module for efsh"]]

To help people easily deploy [[efsh|docs/efsh]],
I released a puppet module, which realises the basic
directory structure.

It's still very incomplete, but you can get a first
impression on
[git.sans.ethz.ch](http://git.sans.ethz.ch/?p=puppet-modules/efsh;a=summary).

# Update #1

I switched over to use [[cdist|software/cdist]] instead of Puppet.

[[!tag eth unix puppet]]
