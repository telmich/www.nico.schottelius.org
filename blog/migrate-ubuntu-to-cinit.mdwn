[[!meta title="Migrate Ubuntu to cinit"]]

I was thinking about which OS to support with
[[cinit|software/cinit]] next. I think that
[FreeBSD](http://www.FreeBSD.Org) and
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) are very interesting
to support with cinit now.

So I decided to write migration scripts for Ubuntus
[upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) for the next version
of cinit.

Because it's a lot of work to migrate an existing init
system, I'm searching for friendly hackers, who help me
to get the migration script up and running:

The idea is to

 * analyse current services
 * create new cinit services
 * clue everything together and bootup much faster

The script
[cinit-conf.migrate.upstart.ubuntu.jaunty](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=cLinux/cinit.git;a=blob;f=scripts/future-bin/cinit-conf.migrate.upstart.ubuntu.jaunty;hb=HEAD)
already contains a minimalistic analysis of Ubuntus upstart. What needs to be done is

 * to read through the listed scripts inside ***cinit-conf.migrate.upstart.ubuntu.jaunty***
 * and to create scripts to create new services in [cinit/bin](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=cLinux/cinit.git;a=tree;f=bin)

So if you want to help to support Ubuntu with cinit, you could

 * analyse one init-script
 * and create the service creators (like [cinit-conf.svc.mount.tmpfs.linux.ubuntu](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=cLinux/cinit.git;a=blob;f=bin/cinit-conf.svc.mount.tmpfs.linux.ubuntu))

If you are interested, please join the
[cinit mailinglist](http://l.schottelius.org/mailman/listinfo/cinit) and let us
know, on which script you hack.
