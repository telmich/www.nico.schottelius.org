[[!meta title="Static image gallery generator comparison (FOSS)"]]

## Introduction

This document describes several static image gallery generators,
their advantages and disadvantages. All of them are FOSS and
have been tested under a Unix like operating system.
If you have any kind of update, do not hesitate to
[[contact me|about]]. I am using a downscaled sample directory
(**basis**) for testing.

I'm not referencing the navigation, but only "Next Image", because
this is probably the most often used navigation part.
