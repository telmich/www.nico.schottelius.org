## Introduction

This page describes fonts I tested for usability in
a terminal emulator. The ratings may be highly subjective
and describe my way to find good fonts.

## How I tested

I'm using a small script named **urxvt-font-change**,
which is part of the nsbin git repository. This script
allows me to dynamically change the font in the running
terminal.


## Objectives

There are a lot of different objectives for choosing
a font that suits you. For me, the following objectives
are interesting: Is the font usable for ...

 * small screens
 * presentations
 * my eyes

The last point is probably mostly subjective, a font
must "look good" to me.


## Font list

And here's the actual font table:


[[!table  data="""
Font name | Size | Recommended | Remarks
xft:Bitstream Vera Serif:style=Roman | big | | Too much whitespace

"""]]


[[!tag unix]]
