## Introduction

Sexy is the Swiss Army Knife for inventory management.
It allows you to manage hosts and network with a simple command
line interface.

Sexy stores inventory information in a **cconfig database** and
adapts to your environment by supporting custom backends.

In short, sexy can create and remove hosts and configure networks -
depending on your backend this means:

 * sexy manages Virtual Machines
 * sexy generates IPv4 address allocation (DHCP)
 * sexy sets up your domain name system (DNS)


## Status

The release process for sexy version 2.0 has started and is planned
to happen in November 2012.

## Installation

Download sexy from git ([gitweb](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=sexy;a=summary)):

    % git clone git://git.schottelius.org/sexy

installed:

    /usr/bin/python3
