## Introduction

Sexy is the the Swiss Army Knife for inventory management.
It allows you to manage hosts and network with a simple command
line interface.

Sexy stores inventory information in a **cconfig database** and
adapts to your environment by supporting custom backends.

In short, sexy can create and remove hosts and configure networks -
depending on your backend this means:

 * sexy manages Virtual Machines
 * sexy generates IPv4 address allocation (DHCP)
 * sexy sets up your domain name system (DNS)

to happen in November 2012.
