<P>ccollect backups data from local and remote hosts to your local harddisk.
Although ccollect creates full backups, it requires very less space on the
backup medium, because ccollect uses hardlinks to create an initial copy of
the last backup. Only the inodes used by the hardlinks and the changed files
need additional space.

ccollect uses [rsync](http://www.samba.org/rsync/) for synchronisation.
Since ccollect-0.2 there is [asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)
based documentation included in the distribution (see below).
You should also be able to configure ccollect with the help of the example
configuration in conf/.
