A small non-queuing lpd

## Introduction
mini-lpd is a small lpd. It does not care about the control file sent, nor
does it honour any lpd specific commands, though it will acknowlegde them.
It takes a document and puts it on the printer. The client will have
to wait until it is printed, as mini-lpd does not have any queue (well, it has,
but only to queue tcp/ip connections ;-).
mini-lpd should run and compile on every UNIX (Linux, BSD, SunOS, ...)
(as of version 0.4).
