To get into EOF through ceofhack, you should make sure you understand
[[how to use|user]] ceofhack in general. Depeding on your skills and
interests, you may either be interested in

 * hacking the core (aka ceofhack, rare developers probably)
 * creating user interfaces (ui)
 * creating transport protocols (tp)

## API documentation

In general, everything you need should be documented in the
EOF standard document. If it's not, it's probably a bug
(in that case, send a patch).

## UI developers

UIs can either live in their own projects or be a part of
ceofhack. The **first** way is recommended, so your development
does not depend on ceofhack.

## Transport protocol developers

TPs can either live in their own projects or be a part of
ceofhack. The **second** way is recommended, so all available
transport protocols are shared with the ceofhack installation.

### Creating a new transport protocol

You can use the following code as a start:

    scheme=phpbb
    implementation=shell
    cd ceofhack/tp
    mkdir -p ${scheme}/${implementation}
    echo "echo listening implementation" > ${scheme}/${implementation}/listen
    echo "echo send implementation" > ${scheme}/${implementation}/send
    chmod 0755 ${scheme}/${implementation}/*

Now you've a dummy "working" transport protocol.

### Enabling a new transport protocol

You can use the following code as a start:

    scheme=phpbb
    implementation=shell
    cd ceofhack/tp

    # Enable protocol in general
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.ceof/tp/available/${scheme}"
    cp "${scheme}/${implementation}/listen" "$HOME/.ceof/tp/available/${scheme}"
    cp "${scheme}/${implementation}/send" "$HOME/.ceof/tp/available/${scheme}"

    # Enable listener for protocol
    address="describe-particular-address"
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.ceof/tp/listen/${scheme}-${address}"
    echo "${scheme}${address}" > "$HOME/.ceof/tp/listen/${scheme}-${address}/url"

### Submitting a transport protocol for inclusion into the mainline

 * Create a branch ${scheme}-${implementation} on your side
 * Submit a pull request (via ML, IRC, github, whatever)
