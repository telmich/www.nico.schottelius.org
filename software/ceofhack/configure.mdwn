## Introduction

ceofhack and all other EOF subsystems need a common place to find themselves
and to function properly.

## Initial configuration: the easy way

Simply run the following line:

    cd ceofhack && ./scripts/init_home.sh

This will 

 * create a the configuration directory **$HOME/.ceof**,
 * create a new pgp key pair,
 * add the tcp transport protool
 * and enable the tcp transport protocol to listen to **0.0.0.0:4242**. 

## Initial configuration: the expert way

Read and understand **./scripts/init_home.sh** and consult
the current EOF standard document.
