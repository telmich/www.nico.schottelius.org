'Geheimnisse' in German


- Dependencies beginning with a '.' (dot) are ignored.
  So you can temporary disable a dependency moving it to
  want/.name

- Why is the name of the socket "coala"?
  Well, coala could mean 'cinit object abstract layer access', but
  perhaps it's a much simpler reason.

- cinit will start a little bit faster, if you omit non needed
  'wants' and 'needs' dirs, as they need to be scanned, if they
  exist
