First of all configure cinit through the configuration files found in conf/.
Especially look at conf/*tmp*.
   
The documentation can be found in doc/.

After reading and configuring use:

   "make all" - to build cinit
   "make install" - to install cinit
   "make install-example" - to install cinit configuration example
      -> WARNING: the last two make targets do not honour $DESTDIR yet!
