First of all configure cinit through the configuration files found in conf/.

The documentation can be found in doc/, read

   README and doc/configuring.cinit

_before_ first use.

After reading and configuring use:

   "make all" - to build cinit
   "make install" - to install cinit
   "make install-miniconf" - to install a minimal cinit-configuration

After that you'll have to configure it. Some sample configurations can be
found on the cinit homepage at http://linux.schottelius.org/cinit/.
