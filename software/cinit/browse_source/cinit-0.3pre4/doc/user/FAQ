Q: So, what's good in cinit?
A: Fast executing, clean design, parallel execution, profile support,
   small binary size (~50KiB static against uclibc), easy configuration,
   just to name the main facts.

Q: How do I start cinit?
A: You don't start cinit directly, but your kernel does.
   Please have a look at your system documentation how to tell your kernel
   to load /sbin/cinit as init. You'll also find some examples in
   the README file.

Q: What is /etc/cinit/init used for?
A: The init service is not just a placeholder, it is the beginning of
   executing services.

Q: /etc/cinit/init seems not to be used when I use profiles?
A: That's true. When you select a profile, cinit will begin in this
   directory: "cprofile:home" will use /etc/cinit/home as starting
   point.

Q: Why does it take so long before my getty is respawned?
A: cinit only waits 5 seconds (see conf/sleep_svc), if
   a) a service didn't exit normally
   b) the service had a non-zero exit code
   
   So fixing the problem would mean fixing your getty / shell.

Q: I am using a tarball from samples/ and there is no getty on tty1!?
A: That's true, the first console is used for logging purpose in the
   examples. You still have six console (tty2-tty7) running getty.
