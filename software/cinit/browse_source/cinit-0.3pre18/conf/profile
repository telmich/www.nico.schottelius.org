cprofile:

The argument should be passed to cinit to recognize that
a profile will follow. "cprofile:" is the standard, as
the Linux kernel eats everything in the form 'var=parm'.
The old (pre cinit-0.1) option "cprofile=" should therefore
NOT be used.

Under Linux you tell it the bootloader like grub or LILO.
