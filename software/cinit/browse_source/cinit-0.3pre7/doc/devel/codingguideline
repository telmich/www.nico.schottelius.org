   Before and after '=', '==', '!='', '>=', '<='

   After ')', ','
   No space before ), so if '))', do not put a space after the first ')'.

Header:
   Put a header into each file, containing:
      - date of file being put into existence (year is enough)
      - Name and E-mail of Author
      - Description of the function

Includes:
   System includes first,
   own headers later

Indent:
   Three spaces. No tabs.

   Indent variable names, so the names begin all at the same position. Use three spaces
   to place them.
