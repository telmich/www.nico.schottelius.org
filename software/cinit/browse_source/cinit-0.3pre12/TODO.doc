caveats
-------

- cinit will sleep after respawing if ...

   a) the service did not terminate normally (!WIFEXITED(status))
   b) the service did return a non-zero exit status

- cinit ignores the Keyboard request
- Currently there is no support to react on 'ctr+alt+del':
- cinit will start a little bit faster if you omit non needed
  'wants' and 'needs' dirs as they need to be scanned if they
   do not exist
- Dependencies beginning with a '.' (dot) are ignored.
  So you can temporarily disable a dependency moving it to
  want/.name
