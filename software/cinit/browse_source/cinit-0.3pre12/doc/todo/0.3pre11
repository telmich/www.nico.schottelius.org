Done:
- cleanup ipc:
   merge cinit_ipc_logon() and cinit_ipc_connect()?
   => already done!
- finish cmd in general, perhaps only including one command.
[18:51] denkbrett:src# LANG=C cp cinit /sbin/cinit 
cp: cannot create regular file `/sbin/cinit': Text file busy
   => mv & cp!
      => documentation!
