- FIX the child handler!
   * check for correct behaviour in tree_exec()
   * think about howto NOT find once, if the system uses duplicated pids
      -> pid reset
      -> check only SH_ONCE?
- Begin documentation
   * Check Makefile
   * Integrate Makefile into main Makefile
   * create manpage
   * Write a small manual
      - install
      - configure
      - boot (different OS)
- do not reports errors, when on or off does not exist!
- check free on dep_del!
- check that the new wants and need elements are nserted the other way round
   * we go to next, elements must be put before us!
- implement do_reboot()
   * so not only booting with cinit works, but also the shutdown
- define messages
   a) human readable
   b) binary data?
   ?
- replace cinit_ipc_logon with cinit_ipc_init...
- cleanup run_svc
   * NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE!
   * remove run_svc?
- implement do_reboot.c

Finally:
- test and release cinit-0.3rc1
