- Add service start/stop to cmd
-> then continue in cinit itself.

   cinit_svc_disable.c

- remove malloc for paths
   use

- cleanly define functions for cmd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- svc_stop_wait()
   => calls svc_stop() and waits until the process
      is finished
         => pay attention for child handler!
         => wait for that specific PID!
         => use global lock?
- answer_svc_stop(char *svc, int method)
   => is called by the IPC methods
   => checks whether the service exists
   => returns the status of the service (NOT_EXISTS or
      the new one)
   => calls svc_stop_wait(), which returns
   => method =
      o including needed_by
      o including wanted_by
      o including needed_by and wanted_by
      o only the service

- cinit blocking while shutting down
   => not good!
   => only needed when being in ipc!
   => otherwise tree_stop() catches that again.
- 
- Documentate off exit codes:
   * 0: successfully stopped
   * 1: internal error: service status unknown
   * 2: ...?

Done for pre14:
- svc_stop()
   => stops an existing service
   => sets status
   => calls "off"
- svc_stop_deps() => takes care about dependencies

- Add comment about path_absolute in manpage of cmd => requires the directory
  to be there.
