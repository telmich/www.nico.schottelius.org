4

Maximum number of digits which may be in the delay file.
If there are more, the string "12345678901" will be cut to the
right length "1234567890". I don't think you'll ever need
a timeout greater 4 digits (9999 seconds are 166,65~ minutes, are
2 hours, 46 minutes and 39 seconds). See doc/configuring.cinit.
