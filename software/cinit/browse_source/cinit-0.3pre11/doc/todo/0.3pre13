- create libcinit.a/so and link against it
- global symbol to track the connection to cinit in the client
   => cinit_ipc_cinit() - initalise ipc in the client (only once)
- cleanup headers:
   seems to make more sense, to have more than one exposed header.
   cinit.h gets to fast too big. so splitoff to:
   <cinit/cinit.h>   /* main  */
   <cinit/types.h>   /* ...   */
