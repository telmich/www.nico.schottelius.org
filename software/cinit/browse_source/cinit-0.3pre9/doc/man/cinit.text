NAME
----
cinit - fast executing, small and simple init with support for profiles


SYNOPSIS
--------
'cinit' [cprofile:name_of_profile]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Cinit is an init system. It normally gets started by the operating
system (Linux, *BSD, ...) directly after the kernel has been loaded.

Cinit uses parallel execution of services as far as possible. To
ensure the correct boot order you need to specify which service
'needs' or 'wants' another service. The resulting dependency tree
is used at startup to determine which service to start when.

This may result in different boot orders depending on whether
one service is one time faster or slower. Due to the dependencies
this is not a problem, but allowed and wished per design.

For more information refer to the texinfo or html documentation.


OPTIONS
-------

cprofile:name_of_profile::
   If specified, cinit will start the named profile instead of the
   standard 'init' service


BUGS
----
cinit is not tested nor documented very well currently.

The porting to other OS is not finished yet (mainly missing
system level binaries: shutdown, reboot, halt).

Both is work in progress.
