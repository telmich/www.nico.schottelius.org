getty init local-tuning local-services mount network remote-services

List of directories normally created below /etc/cinit/svc/ as
'pseudo-services'.

Btw, 'init' is the first service and has always to be there, but it does not really
fit into here, because it's a real one, compraed to the pseudo services.
