'Geheimnisse' in German


- Dependencies beginning with a '.' (dot) are ignored.
  So you can temporary disable a dependency moving it to
  want/.name

- Why is the name of the socket "coala"?
  Well, coala could mean 'cinit object abstract layer access', but
  perhaps it's a much simpler reason.

- cinit will start a little bit faster, if you omit non needed
  'wants' and 'needs' dirs, as they need to be scanned, if they
   exist

- Currently there is no support to react on 'ctr+alt+del':
   1. It is not handled to switch on / off
      (Linux: See man 2 reboot and /proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del)
   2. If the kernel handles it and sends signals to cinit
      (SIGINT on Linux) they will be ignored.
      There is no problem in implementing a handler for this signal,
      the only reason why it is not there
      (well, a template is in old/sig_special.c) is that noone
      could tell me what would be the most senseful thing to handle
      ctrl-alt-del. If you can, I'll perhaps integrate it.

- cinit ignores the Keyboard request
   Same thing with 'ctr-alt-del': SIGWINCH is sent, but I don't
   know what todo when recieving it.

- cinit does not care about its pid
  nor does cinit care if it is already running

  in serv/cinit.c is a line calling run_init_svc().
  If you call that only if getpid() == 1, cinit will behave like sysvinit

  Currently cinit has no chance to control whether it's started or
  not as /etc/cinit/tmp mounted again for every start.
