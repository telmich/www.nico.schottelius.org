THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE, NOT YET THOUGHT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT!
****************************************************************************

First of all configure cinit through the configuration files found in conf/.
Especially look at conf/*tmp*.
   
The documentation can be found in doc/, please read doc/configuring.cinit
before first use.

After reading and configuring use:

   "make all" - to build cinit
   "make install" - to install cinit
   "make install-conf" - to install cinit configuration example
      -> WARNING: the last make target does not honour $DESTDIR yet!
