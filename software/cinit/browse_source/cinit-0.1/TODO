--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Source Logic issues
   - remove FIXME entries (and what should be fixed, too)
   - cleanup sig_reboot.c
   - memset for timespecs?
   - move umount, swapoff and remount to off of init?
      -> cleanup sig_reboot.c
   - run_svc:
      o we have many strcat()s, perhaps save length of pathbuf and strncat at
         pathtmp[strlen(pathbuf)] ?
   - do we really need swapoff?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Documentation
   - Write manpages (use doc/* as base for that)
   - Check Spell and Grammar in documentation
   - write howto:
      o Howto-cinit
      o Howto-cinit-uml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
create_mini_cinit / configuration samples
   -> use a tarball? (samples/*)
   -> create something which should be runnable
      -> mount, fsck, getty
         --> for dev in `read /etc/fstab` ...
               fsck $dev
         --> getty from /etc/inittab or /sbin/*getty
            -> find out, which gettys with which params
   -> use it on 'make install'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional tasks:

   - check for other possibilities to create a smaller binary
      - strip options
      - gcc options
      - ld options
      - alternative libc (uclibc and dietlibc work fine!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things I did not do and I don't know whether we have to care about:

- Porting
   - add porting code to other unices?
   - like openssh guys do?

- close(*>2) before forking / executing
   -> close fds, clean environment, etc., ...
   -> do we really need that?
- logging service!
   -> write output $somewhere, wait for syslog?
   -> flush at the end of start-process?
   -> perhaps pipe logging output to a program?
