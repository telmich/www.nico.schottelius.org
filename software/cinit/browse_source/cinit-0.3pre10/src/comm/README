All abstracted communication functions. Do not depend on the underlying
inter process communication mechanism.

   - send_command(): client function: sends a command to cinit
   - send_service(): client function: send the service name to operate on

   - read_command(): server function: reads beginning of a command
      * Extracts the command
      * reads client identification (=pid)
      * calls other functions, depending on the command send => switch()
   - read_service(): server function: reads service

   - write_answer(): server function: answer?
      * sends answers to clients => senseful?


   TODO:
      - define information function, that returns various information about
        a service
