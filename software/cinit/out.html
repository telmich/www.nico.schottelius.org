<h1><A NAME="out">Open unassigned Tasks</a></h1>
These are tasks that should be done, but no one is working on them currently.
If you have some programming experience and want to take a task simply contact
me or somenone on <A HREF="irc://irc.freenode.org/#cLinux">#cLinux</A>.
Those tasks, which are finished can be found on the
<A HREF="cat.html">closed assigned tasks</A> page.
<ol>
   <li>Writing the tool "<b>cinit.graph.graphic</b>" which visualizes the
   dependency tree in a graphic.
   <BR>It should print the service dependency hierarchy: At the
   top should be the init directore (/etc/cinit/svc/init or if given on
   command line: The starting profile [cprofile=home]) and then below it
   should be printed the pyramide of dependency.
   <BR>Output should be PNG and SVG. One should be able to switch between
   PNG and SVG via command line (like -t and --type png or svg).
   <li><b>porting cinit</b> - currently cinit is Linux specific:
   <ul>
      <li>The tempfs setting will most likely be Linux specfic (conf/*tmp*)
      as the mount call is.
   </ul>
   One would have to change cinit
   <ul>
      <li>to use os-specific mount parameters / call and use the specfic
      tempfs
   </ul>
   You are free to implement it and make a patch available, which
   <ul>
      <li>is either maintained outside of cinit (like the openssh guys do)
      <li>or which incorporates cleanly into cinit (use conf/*, bin/* to
      configure, try to avoid ugly #ifdefs)
   </ul>
   The main parts to change in cinit would be:
   <ul>
      <li>changing serv/cinit.c to allow different mount calls
      <li>changing conf/*tmp* to fit to the unix you use
      <li>or add a script to bin/, which sets conf/*tmp* depending on
          the output of uname -s
   </ul>
   <li><B>Writing a HOWTO</B> install, configure and use cinit.
       It should be understandable by people which never touched cinit
       before. The format should be anything which can be read or
       converted easily
       (<A HREF="http://nico.schotteli.us/papers/linux/cconfig/">cconfig</A>
       variant or LaTeX for documentation?).
       Or the howto should be written in the
       <A HREF="http://wiki.clinux.info/index.php/Cinit">wiki</A>
       (currently down, contact me in #cLinux, irc.freenode.org)
   <li><B>Preparing cinit-master-configuration</B>, a clean configuration, which
          may be used by a cinit-config program to extract a service to
          the real configuration directory. Access should be done via
          git or similar to allow different people to upload their configuration.
   <li><B>Programming cinit-config</B>, a program, most likely a gui
       (dialog based?), which helps people to configure cinit. Perhaps
       using a/the master configuration and prompting the user to configure
       a template and copy the result + needs to /etc/cinit then.
   <li><B>Programming convert tools</B>, to convert other init systems
       automatically to cinit (see
       <A HREF="browse_source/cinit-0.1/doc/merging.other.initsystems">cinit-0.1/doc/merging.other.initsystems</A>).
