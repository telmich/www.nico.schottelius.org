cinit configuration (x86/debian)

- There are many services, which are not started, but which could be used
  by you (dmcrypt,mount/home/fsck...)
- /home is mounted without fsck, as the fsck for reiserfs is broken here
- syslogd seems to be broken, it does not honour -n
- syslog-ng accepts -F, so using that
- atd is broken, do not start it (it does not have a not-background
  flag either)
