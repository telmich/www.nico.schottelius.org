-   Dear reader,
-
-
-      you are reading this document, because you saw that there is a new
-      release of gpm available, gpm 1.20.2.
-
-      Unfortunately this release is broken, but that's not a big problem.
-
-      gpm is broken for some time and I did not spent any time to the project
-      for about two years.
-
-      Some weeks ago, I was contacted by someone asking me to write a very
-      small feature for gpm (a small client program, included in this
-      release). I answered the person that I do not have the time to code
-      that part, but if he really insists that I should write that code,
-      he should think about sponsoring me [0].
-
-      Some days later I recieved an email that he wanted to sponsor me.
-      I was a little bit surprised, because it was the first person really
-      considering my sponsoring plans.
-      
-      So I coded that small program and had some views in the old code of
-      gpm. There's so much information in it, so many hacks, so many dirty
-      tricks and there are still many people using it.
-
-      So I considered to try to spent more time to gpm, perhaps even creating
-      a more clean (and better maintainable) version of it.
-
-      But I _am_ actually a pretty busy person, working almost all time, if not
-      doing sports (just about 6 hours a week) or sleeping.
-
-      So I thought, perhaps you can help me to get more time for coding FOSS [1]
-      in general or gpm in specific:
-
-      My idea is, that if you consider sponsoring my work, I can begin to work less
-      "traditionally" and also finance my second study in computer science, which
-      I will begin in autumn 2008, if I have the money to do it (living in
-      Switzerland is not that cheap).
-
-      I am looking forward to get any feedback from you about this idea
-      at nico-gpm-sponsoring (at) schottelius.org.
-
-      Thanks for reading,
-

+This file tells how to use gpm with the driver for event-devices
+that use absolut coordiantes (evabs) like touchscreens. It was
+desigened and tested for eGalax controllers, but should work with
+others as well.
+
+
+		CALIBRATION
+		-----------
+
+Calibration is done with a configfile. It consists of a single
+line of 8 integers:
+
+ex_min ex_max ey_min ey_max sx_min sx_max sy_min sy_max
+
+The first four values (prefixed withe here) show the minimum and 
+maximum values of coordinates the event-device delivers for 
+x- and y-axis, respectivly. The last four values show range of 
+coordinates to which the input should be scaled, for example your
+screen resolution. This works for text-mode, too.
+
+An example for an 800x600 screen would look like this:
+
+50 1950 50 1950 0 799 0 599 
+
+
+		GPM OPERATION
+		-------------
+
+You need to use the evabs devicetype to use this feature, a 
+device that delivers the absolute coordinates a config-file
+that describes how to scale these coordinates, and a repeater-
+device used for output.
+The pseudo-file /proc/bus/input/devices should tell you which 
+event-device to use.
+
+Usage example:
+
+gpm -t evabs  -m /dev/input/event2 -c /etc/gpm-calib.conf -R ps2
