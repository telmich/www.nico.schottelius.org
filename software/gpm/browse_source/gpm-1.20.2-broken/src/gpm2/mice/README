This directory should contain the mice-protocol implementations.

Each file (or if bigger: directory) implements one protocol.

You have to create three functions:

   gpm2_open_<protocol>();
   gpm2_handle_<protocol>();
   gpm2_close_<protocol>();

It's not yet clear, how to register protocols to gpm2.
