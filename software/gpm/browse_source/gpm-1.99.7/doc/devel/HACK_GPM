Hello!

Nice that you read this document, looks like someone wants to improve gpm again.
I assume you have a good idea or you did some good work you want to see in the
main gpm tree. To make life easy for you and me, please follow the instructions:

   * if you send a patch, explain why it's needed
   * if possible, please patch against latest git sources (see README in top level directory)
   * if the patch introduces generally new things, explain how it works
   * use 3 spaces tabs in the source files (if you use tabs, look into
     contrib/scripts/replace_tab_with_3_spaces)
   * Coding style is defined by this indent_script:
      http://unix.schottelius.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=misc/nico-bin.git;a=tree
   * make small patch files
   * include directory structure (src/mice.c and not mice.c)

Thanks for your help,

Nico
