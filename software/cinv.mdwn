## Preamble

Cinv was formerly known under name the of **sexy**.

## Introduction

Cinv is the Swiss Army Knife for inventory management.
It allows you to manage hosts and network with a simple command
line interface.

Cinv stores inventory information in a **cconfig database** and
adapts to your environment by supporting custom backends.

In short, cinv can create and remove hosts and configure networks -
depending on your backend this means:

 * cinv manages Virtual Machines
 * cinv generates IPv4 address allocation (DHCP)
 * cinv sets up your domain name system (DNS)


## Status

The release process for cinv version 2.0 has started and is planned
to happen in November 2012.

## Installation

Download cinv from git ([gitweb](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=cinv;a=summary)):

    % git clone git://git.schottelius.org/cinv

Afterwards ensure that the **bin** directory is in your PATH and that you have python3
installed:

    % which python3
    /usr/bin/python3
    % cd cinv
    % export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin

Now you should be able to display the current cinv version:

    % cinv -V
    cinv 1.9.11-1-g837532c
