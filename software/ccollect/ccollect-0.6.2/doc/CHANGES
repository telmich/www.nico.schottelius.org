0.6.1 to 0.6.2:
   * Added analyse-ccollect-logs.sh
   * Fixed bug: Removing of backups was broken since update to 0.6
     (forgot to prepend path...)
   * Fixed bug: The marker was always deleted, because rsync deleted it.
     Create it outside of the backup destination now.

0.6 to 0.6.1:
   * Added check for destination_base in add_ccollect_source.sh
   * Added support for -V and --version
   * Added ccollect-logwrapper.sh (and a manpage ;-)
   * Changed behaviour: ccollect now clones from the latest existing backup,
     independent of the interval. This way different intervals do not
     diverge. ccollect uses ls -c to determine latest backup.

0.5.2 to 0.6:
   * Always print return code of rsync
   * Add much more timing information
   * One option per line in rsync_options now (NOT space seperated)
   * Added --sparse as default option
   * Added management tools (including manpages):
      * add_ccollect_source.sh
      * delete_ccollect_source.sh
      * list_ccollect_intervals.sh
   * Cleaned up exit calls (now always cleanly removes temporary files)
   * In theory, added pdf documentation (though, was unable to do it with fop)
   * Changed license to GPLv3 (from GPLv2)

0.5.1 to 0.5.2:
   * Display correct error code, if rsync returns non-zero
   * Unify messages
   * Remove some potential quoting problems

0.5 to 0.5.1:
   * Remove always printed debug information

0.4.3 to 0.5:
   * Removed requirement PaX
   * Removed requirement bc

0.4.2 to 0.4.3:
   * Display error code of rsync, if non-zero (for further analysis)
   * Fix Makefile, so 'make install' works on others OS
   * reorder $RSYNC_EXTRA, so it can be overriden by users

0.4.1 to 0.4.2:
   * fixed bug when $CCOLLECT_CONF is relative
   * added Quickstart to documentation

0.4 to 0.4.1:

   * fixed problem with 'make install' (strip was used)
   * fixed possible problem with pre_exec beeing executed to late
   * fixed small bug in sed expression: using 'source/' made it fail

0.3.3 to 0.4:
   * `pax` (Posix) is now required, `cp -al` (GNU specific) is removed
   * "interval" was written with two 'l' (ell), which is wrong in English
   * Changed the name of backup directories, removed the colon in the interval
   * ccollect will now exit, when preexec returns non-zero
   * ccollect now reports when postexec returns non-zero

0.3.2 to 0.3.3:
   * Fix a small bug, which suppressed information when rsync exits non-zero

0.3.1 to 0.3.2:
   * ccollect now prints the start time, end time and duration of the backup

0.3 to 0.3.1:
   * added support for printing a summary
   * some cosmetic changes

0.2 to 0.3:
   * added "very_verbose"
   * normal "verbose" is now less verbose
   * added general 'pre_exec' and 'post_exec' support
   * added source specfifc 'pre_exec' and 'post_exec' support

0.1 to 0.2:
   * Added plausibility check
   * Updated and made documentation readable
   * implemented verbose option
   * Fixed double exclude parameter bug
   * Added much better documentation (asciidoc)
   * added rsync extra parameter option
