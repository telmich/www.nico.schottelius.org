These todos are things that would be senseful todo, but are just nice
to have. This means I won't code them, so somebody can code them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add ccollect-restore.sh
  (new project, perhaps coordinated with jchome's ccollect-config)
  
  Helper (in dialog?) to restore backups

  Perhaps create ccollect-gui.{whatever} instead, which does all the
  end user staff?

  Including cronjob, creating configuration, displaying status of
  backups, allowing manual remove, allowing manual trigger of ccollect
  (with realtime message window?)?

- write mkccollectconfig (for 0.5!)
   -> jchome works on it!
   o create source configuration
   o another script for changing defaults
      x intervalls
      x pre-/post exec
   o (X)dialog based

- add option ("run_only_once") to prevent ccollect to run twice
  (per source/general)
