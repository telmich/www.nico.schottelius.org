Thanks go to the following people:

* the whole #cLinux channel
   - for testing and debugging (those I mean should know ;-)
* Alexey Maximov
   - for finding return-value and shell limitation bugs
* Markus Meier
   - for finding a really simple solution for choosing the right backup to
     clone from: Make it independent of the interval, simply choose the last
     one created.
