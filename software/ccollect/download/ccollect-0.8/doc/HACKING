Hello Hacker,

I really appreciate your interest in hacking this software, but
I am kind of critical when seeing patches. Thus I created this
file to give you some hints of my thinking quirks.


Submitting patches
------------------
Make my life easier, make your life easier, use a version control system (vcs).
For this software the preferred vcs is git. Clone the latest repo, create
a new local branch (git checkout -b <branchname>) write down your ideas.

When you're done, push all your stuff out to some public repo and drop a
mail to the mailinglist, what you did and where to get it.


Introduce a feature or change behaviour
---------------------------------------
Uhh, fancy! You have had a great idea, then it's time to change
the major version, so others know that something changed.

If the configuration format is changed, add a script to tools/
to allow users upgrade their configuration to this major version.

And now comes the most difficult part: Add documentation. Nobody
benefits from your cool feature, if it is not known. I know, writing
documentation is not so much fun, but you also expect good documentation
for this software, don't you?


If you think my thinking quirks must be corrected
-------------------------------------------------
See above ("Submitting patches") and submit a patch to this file.


Thanks for reading.
