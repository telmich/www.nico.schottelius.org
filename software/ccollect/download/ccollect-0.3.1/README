ccollect was inspired by rsnapshot [1], which had some problems:
   - configuration parameters had to be TAB seperated
   - you could not specify exclude lists differently for every source
   - no per source pre/post execution support
   - no parallel execution
   - I didn't like the configuration at all, so I used the cconfig style [2].
