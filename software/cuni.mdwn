## About

cuni creates unix network installers. It is for those of you, who
(want to) run a tftp server and install their clients from the network.

## Using cuni

Type ***cuni*** and read the usage description.

## Using the unix installers

Most unix installers have different semantics for execution.
Some of them are able to do automatic installations, some of
them even need a hint on what to boot from where.

It is planned to make this information available directly in
cuni, but until then, examples on how to use them are provided
here:

### Debian/Ubuntu

 * Can be automated using Preseed

Syslinux sample code:

    LABEL debian_lenny_amd64
      MENU LABEL Debian Lenny amd64
      KERNEL syslinux/pxechain.com
      APPEND ::debian/amd64/lenny/pxelinux.0

### OpenBSD

Syslinux sample code:

    # works, needs "openbsd/bsd.rd"
    LABEL openbesdtest
       MENU LABEL OpenBSD
       KERNEL syslinux/pxechain.com
       APPEND ::openbsd/pxeboot




## Adding a new OS installer

Assume, you want to add support for the installer of OS "kroet", which requires
the arguments "version" and "arch".

    * Define arguments needed
    kroet_args="version arch"

    # Add code here, that is executed in the destination directory
    cuni_kroet()
    {
      # MUST Define ddir: subdirectory which contains the actual installer
      ddir="${arch}/${version}"

      # MUST Define bootfile: file that should be booted
      bootfile="$ddir/pxelinux.0"

      # create os specific directory structure
      # get os specific installer
    }

## Testing a new OS installer

You can test the new installation with qemu for example:

    qemu-kvm -boot n -net nic -net user,hostname=cunitest,tftp=/home/services/tftp/root,bootfile=/pxelinux.0
