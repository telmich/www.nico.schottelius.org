As every computer geek, I also have a long history of used computers,
which I publish here, to be able to look back what I used once.

This document also explains the origin of most computer names I have been using.

This site was originally know as **tech.schottelius.org**.

## Servers

### suppe.schottelius.org

First, in 1998, there was **suppe.schottelius.org**. It was my first
webserver, dns-server and mail-server. I recieved it as a gift
from a kindergarten, because it was too slow for them.
The name is derived from the German phrase "suppelte herum",
which means "is still working, but may break if you look at it
too strong".

You actually should have seen it, it consisted of the following hardware:

    Chassis:       Midi-Tower
    Processor:     Intel Pentium 120Mhz
    RAM:           48 MiB (16+16+8+8)
    Harddisk:      2 GiB IDE (PIO mode/16Bit ;)
    NIC:           Some 3Com PCI 10Mbit (3c509?)
    CDROM:         Something like that appeared to be installed
    Floppy         1x3,5" , 2x5,25"

 * Productive use: 2000 - 2003

### bruehe.schottelius.org

Later, in 2003, **suppe** was replaced by **bruehe**. One day, broth ran
into the **bruehe**, and **bruehe** is the German word for broth.

The first version of **bruehe** had the following technical features:

    Chassis:          Midi-Tower
    Processor:        Pentium3 550Mhz
    RAM:              640 MB (256+128+128+128)
    Harddisk (scsi):  3* 4 GB scsi-3 (raid 1, one spare disk)
    Harddisk (ide):   3* 40 GB ide/udma100 (raid 1, one spare disk)
    NIC (lan):        3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
    NIC (dmz):        3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
    NIC (inet):       Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS)
    NIC (wlan):       Global Sun Technology Inc
    Optical drive:    IDE DVD(+/-, R/RW,RAM) -Burner (old: 32x IDE)
    Floppy:           removed (was: 1x3,5")

Later the one scsi and one ide drive was removed due to problems
with the power supply. And an additional NIC was put into.

At the time **bruehe** was replaced by **creme** (see below) it became
the firewall for the lan at home.

 * Productive use: 2003 - 2006

Bruehe is actually still in use, but only as a table below my desk.

### creme.schottelius.org

Because a customer of me broke a contract, I had to keep
a very nice dual Xeon server back. This one became 
**creme.schottelius.org**. The name comes from "creme de la creme"
which means "one of the best".

    Chassis:       2U
    Processor:     Dual Single core Xeon 2.40 Ghz
    RAM:           1024 MB (2*512)
    Harddisk:      2* 80 GB ide/udma (raid1)
    NIC:           2* Intel(R) PRO/1000
    CDROM:         Slim line IDE 52x DVD

 * Productive use: 2005 - 2008

### tee.schottelius.org

After creme, I bought a smaller 1U server with remote access.
As it is smaller and thinner then creme, it was named tee.
Here are the specs:

    Chassis:       Intel S5000PAL
    Processor:     Quad Core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5410  @ 2.33GHz
    RAM:           20 GiB (2*2 GiB, 4*4 GiB)
    Harddisk:      2* 500 GB sata (raid1)
    Raid:          ARC-1210 4-Port PCI-Express to SATA RAID Controller
    NIC:           2* Intel 80003ES2LAN (Gigabit)
    CDROM:         Available

 * Productive use: 2008 - now

## Notebooks

 * Productive use: 1998 - 2003

### scice.intern.schottelius.org

After **flapp** died in 2003 (because tea ran into it), I bought
**scice**. **Scice** is combined of "scientific" and "silence".

Scice has a Transmeta TM5400 processor and no active cooling. It
was produced by ECS under the name of "A530".

    Processor:     Transmeta(tm) Crusoe(tm) Processor TM5600, 600Mhz

### ei.intern.schottelius.org

Unknown time. Was an IBook G3.

    Processor:    Power PC

### hydrogenium.intern.schottelius.org

When the accu of **scice** ended its livetime about one year after
I bought it, I decided to buy a used Compaq Evo N400C.

    Processor:    Pentium III (Coppermine) 850 Mhz
    Display:      12" TFT

 * Productive use: 2005 - 2008

### wasserstoff.intern.schottelius.org

To be more precise, when I bought **hydrogenium**, I also bought
**wasserstoff**, which is also a used Compaq Evo N400C. **Wasserstoff**
is simply there to spend parts, when **hydrogenium** needs to have
them replaced.


### ast.intern.schottelius.org

## Workstations/Desktops

Systems I used as workstations:

### ozean.intern.schottelius.org

My first own computer was a Pentium 1 bought from Aldi.
Before that I used my father's computer.
The case of that computer was painted blue with
penguins on it by a friend of mine. That case
actually become the case of bruehe later. Currently
I do not even remember the naem I gave that box.

    Processor: Pentium 1, 166 Mhz
    Harddisk: 700 MB + 1 GB SCSI (exchanged the 4 GB IDE HD that came with it)
    RAM: around 16 MiB
    Graphics card: ATI with 2 MiB
    CD-ROM: Single speed SCSI with caddy running at triple speed


    * Productive use: ???? - ~2000

### eiche.intern.schottelius.org

Then my father gave me his old computer for present, which was
named **eiche** (oak in English), because it has a big-tower case.

    Processor:       Intel Pentium IV (mostly running at 80 C)


### buche.intern.schottelius.org

**buche** replaced **eiche** on 2006-06-10, because the mainboard
of **eiche** had some problems with the Promise ide controller.
**buche** should now be the file and backup server for the persons
living in our home.

    Processor:     AMD Athlon(tm) Processor, 800Mhz
    RAM:           1152MiB
    Optical drive: DVD-RAM (CD-RW, DVD+/-R/RW)

    Other:         4x USB2.0, 4xUSB1.1

    * Productive use: at least in 2007

### dosinux.intern.schottelius.org

because I used dosbox to run old games on it.

### grauerstar

Nice workstations from HP, a
[[HP J6000|hpJ6000datasheet.pdf]] featured with
a HPPA processsor. I was running it with both Debian and Gentoo.

    Processor:    Dual PA8600 (PCX-W+), 552 Mhz
    HD:           18 GiB SCSI (SCA)

 * Used: ~2006 - ~2008 (unclear)
 * No real productive use, just played around with it.

### grauerklon

know how many HPPAs you need, don't you?
