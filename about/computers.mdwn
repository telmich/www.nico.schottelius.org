As every computer geek, I also have a long history of used computers,
which I publish here, to be able to look back what I used once.

This document also explains the origin of most computer names I have been using.

This site was originally know as **tech.schottelius.org**.

## Notebooks

To be done. :-)

## Servers

### suppe.schottelius.org

First, in 1998, there was `suppe.schottelius.org`. It was my first
webserver, dns-server and mail-server. I recieved it as a gift
from a kindergarten, because it was too slow for them.
The name is derived from the German phrase "suppelte herum",
which means "is still working, but may break if you look at it
too strong".

You actually should have seen it, it consisted of the following hardware:

    Chassis:       Midi-Tower
    Processor:     Intel Pentium 120Mhz
    RAM:           48 MiB (16+16+8+8)
    Harddisk:      2 GiB IDE (PIO mode/16Bit ;)
    NIC:           Some 3Com PCI 10Mbit (3c509?)
    CDROM:         Something like that appeared to be installed
    Floppy         1x3,5" , 2x5,25"

 * Productive use: 2000 - 2003

### bruehe.schottelius.org

Later, in 2003, `suppe` was replaced by `bruehe`. One day, broth ran
into the `bruehe`, and `bruehe` is the German word for broth.

The first version of `bruehe` had the following technical features:

    Chassis:          Midi-Tower
    Processor:        Pentium3 550Mhz
    RAM:              640 MB (256+128+128+128)
    Harddisk (scsi):  3* 4 GB scsi-3 (raid 1, one spare disk)
    Harddisk (ide):   3* 40 GB ide/udma100 (raid 1, one spare disk)
    NIC (lan):        3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
    NIC (dmz):        3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
    NIC (inet):       Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS)
    NIC (wlan):       Global Sun Technology Inc
    Optical drive:    IDE DVD(+/-, R/RW,RAM) -Burner (old: 32x IDE)
    Floppy:           removed (was: 1x3,5")

Later the one scsi and one ide drive was removed due to problems
with the power supply. And an additional NIC was put into.

At the time `bruehe` was replaced by `creme` (see below) it became
the firewall for the lan at home.

### creme.schottelius.org

Because a customer of me broke a contract, I had to keep
a very nice dual Xeon server back. This one became 
`creme.schottelius.org`. The name comes from "creme de la creme"
which means "one of the best".

    Chassis:       2U
    Processor:     Dual Single core Xeon 2.40 Ghz
    RAM:           1024 MB (2*512)
    Harddisk:      2* 80 GB ide/udma (raid1)
    NIC:           2* Intel(R) PRO/1000
    CDROM:         Slim line IDE 52x DVD

 * Productive use: 

### tee.schottelius.org

After creme, I bought a smaller 1U server with remote access.
As it is smaller and thinner then creme, it was named tee.
Here are the specs:

    Chassis:       Intel S5000PAL
    Processor:     Quad Core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5410  @ 2.33GHz
    RAM:           20 GiB (2*2 GiB, 4*4 GiB)
    Harddisk:      2* 500 GB sata (raid1)
    Raid:          ARC-1210 4-Port PCI-Express to SATA RAID Controller
    NIC:           2* Intel 80003ES2LAN (Gigabit)
    CDROM:         Available

 * Productive use: 2008 - now
