Over the years I created one and another website for a specific task.

Today there are plenty of websites currently up and running.

The idea of this site is to sooner or later consolidate some of the following ones:

* [very old personal website (to be merged into this one)](http://nico.schotteli.us/)
* [old personal website (to be merged into this one)](http://nico.schottelius.org/)
* [UNIX related projects](http://unix.schottelius.org/)
* [irc related data/information (to be merged into this site)](http://irc.schottelius.org/)
* [mailing lists](http://l.schottelius.org)

## This website
